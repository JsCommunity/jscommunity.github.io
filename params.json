Ensure no libraries become unmaintained and its users orphaned\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\n- Working together\r\n- Stop [*Not invented here* syndrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Structural\r\n\r\n1. At least one maintainer (preferably a few)\r\n1. More than one npm owner (reduce the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor))!\r\n1. Community oriented (see the [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct]))\r\n1. Issues and pull requests should be handled (answered, merged, closed) quickly\r\n\r\n### Technical\r\n\r\n1. Do one thing and do it well\r\n1. Tend toward being fully tested\r\n    - continuous integration (Node and/or browsers) ([Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) may help)\r\n    - code coverage\r\n1. The least and lightest dependencies possible\r\n1. Keep dependencies up-to-date ([Greenkeeper](http://greenkeeper.io) may help)\r\n\r\n## Code of conduct\r\n\r\n*TODO: replace by a more complete one such as [this one](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/).*\r\n\r\n### Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Be friendly and patient\r\n- Be welcoming\r\n- Be considerate\r\n- Be careful in the words that we choose\r\n- Try to understand why we disagree\r\n\r\n### Reporting issues\r\n\r\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior —or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via julien.fontanet@isonoe.net.
